"We be the people of the Insect Tribe"

"If I can jam, then I am."

"Children of the concrete"

Heavily urbanized, the Insect Tribe has found a new nature in their concrete jungle.

Their muzik makes heavy use of samples from what they consider the "stream of culture" And all streams empty out into the oceanous void. They are skeptical of the idea of true originality, believing everything is derivative, iterative, and inevitable.

They don't fear The Big End because they belief life to be largely derivative of the lifeless nature of the universe before. 
They don't see their embrace of the mechanical to be a rejection of nature, but rather as respect to the larger underlying
nature of all natural forces, 'alive or otherwise'.
