The Air out There and Dereleict SwikStop:
	Sib's eyes lit up at the prospect of exploring a derelict Swik Stop[Just came up with swick, sounds fun; lickety swik]. 
	Without another word she pulled the door of the van open and I gasp sharply before plugging my mouth with my open palm. She broke
	into a wicked laugh: "Oh c'mon, cuz. You can get Air nearly everywhere nowadays. Maybe you could find sunray farmers out in the moonies
	still sporting fish bowls. I knew I should've gotten you outta that city more." I pull my hand from my mouth in a very deliberate fashion,
	my dramatic scowl mirroring her omnipresent smirk.
	
	"I don't think they're open." I say, dryly. "Ooh contra, money-me," she grinned broadly, "This place is now proper open 24 hours a day." 
	She utilized the lack of gravity and moonie walked into the store. After a few tenative 'steps' I float in after her. The entrance was 
	covered in stringy white vegetation. "Sprouts" Sib spat. Her reverse entrance into the place now had her covered in the stuff. We came
	upon an old vending machine, "SPROUT SHAKES: MADE FROM ULTRA FOODS WITH A REAL BEAN SPROUT GARNISH" she read aloud, obnoxiously a-loud.
	
	I wondered what happened to this place, besides the seedy takeover. "Downsizing, probably" Sib explained, "Way way back the universe was
	expanding, until it stopped, then it started shrinking. Apparently this was bad for business, they didn't want muiltiple gas stations
	in the same parsec."

The Wax Planet and the Candle Cove:
	Initially the founder of the wax planet just wanted the largest wax muesem in the world, but somehow the project spiraled in scale until
	it became a world in itself. Unfortunately the great downsizing put it close to a star, and the collosal decorative wick at the planet's
	north pole proved even more unfortunate. By the downsizing's end it was out of range of the star, but was left in a cold spot, so the 
	population found itself having to keep the flame going so they wouldn't freeze. Now the planet looked like a rotting apple, the top
	collapsing in on itself.
