The Air out There and Dereleict SwikStop:
	Sib's eyes lit up at the prospect of exploring a derelict Swik Stop[Just came up with swick, sounds fun; lickety swik]. 
	Without another word she pulled the door of the van open and I gasp sharply before plugging my mouth with my open palm. She broke
	into a wicked laugh: "Oh c'mon, cuzz. You can get Air nearly everywhere nowadays. Maybe you could find sunray farmers out in the moonies
	still sporting fish bowls. I knew I should've gotten you outta that city more." I pull my hand from my mouth in a very deliberate fashion,
	my dramatic scowl mirroring her omnipresent smirk.
	
	"I don't think they're open." I say, dryly. "Ooh contrarr, money-me," she grinned broadly, "A derelict place is never closed." 
	She utilized the lack of gravity and moonie walked into the store. After a few tenative 'steps' I float in after her. The entrance was 
	covered in stringy white vegetation. "Sprouts" Sib spat. Her reverse entrance into the place now had her covered in the stuff. We came
	upon an old vending machine, "SPROUT SHAKES: MADE FROM ULTRA FOODS WITH A REAL BEAN SPROUT GARNISH" she read aloud, obnoxiously a-loud.
	
	I wondered what happened to this place, besides the seedy takeover. "Downsizing, probably" Sib explained, "Way way back the universe was
	expanding, until it stopped, then it started shrinking. Apparently this was bad for business, they didn't want muiltiple stations
	in the same parsec." 
	
	Sib started looking around the shelves, though there didn't seem to be any food left under all the, well, organic food. I walked behind the
	counter and wondered how long it had been since a s'muk like me had been working this counter. There's a scritpad on a shelf under the 
	register on a shelf, you guess there's still enough background radiation to keep it going. The front 'page' has an unfinished looking 
	inventory chart. You flip it over to find a treasure trove of doodles, from boredom long pRs'd. With every flip you find more, much of it
	a fun interpratation of the system around you. one doodle has a giant space monster blowing out planets that are also candles. You recognize 
	one with the general shape of your city, but it's a bee hive, with cars buzzing all around it, you smile, but it feels forced somehow. you 
	decide you've had your fill and flip the tablet vertically, returning it to the front page, and set it back down. You notice something on
	the shelf next to it.
	
	"FWAH!" SHUNK
	
	Sib slams a sickle on the count, hard enough to dig in a couple inches and ruin your pants. "GODDAMNIT SIB" Your heart pounds. "Sorry, I found
	a bucket of sickles, and I had to do /something/ with it." One day she's gonna kill you, you think, or I'll kill her. She giggles and runs
	off and you look back at the shelf. After brushing some loose vegetation away you can see someone had carved "I was here" into it, possibly
	the doodler. The sickle stands patiently on the counter.
		Carve your name:
<<<<<<< HEAD
			Give them, whoever they happen to be, something to remember you by

			Give them something to remember you by
			Cuz you can
>>>>>>> master
			You feel a sense of solidarity with the clerk of the past
		or set the sickle back down:
			Cuz this place won't last much longer
			it's dumb
	
<<<<<<< HEAD
	As you finish carving/As you start to set the sickle down a shout sends you out of your skin, "What're y'all doing here?". I hold my hands up, sickle still in hand, until I

	quickly put it behind your back; though I realized he probably wasn't busting me for vandalism. The voice came from what appeared to be
	an ol' timey cowboy complete with a sheriff star.
	
	"Prot put your hands down, no way this guy's legit. Let'g get out of here"

The Wax Planet and the Candle Cove:
	Initially the founder of the wax planet just wanted the largest wax muesem in the world, but somehow the project spiraled in scale until
	it became a world in itself. Unfortunately the great downsizing put it close to a star, and the collosal decorative wick at the planet's
	north pole proved even more unfortunate. By the downsizing's end (or has it ended?) it was out of range of the star, but was left in a cold spot, so the 
	population found itself having to keep the flame going so they wouldn't freeze. Now the planet looked like a rotting apple, the top
	collapsing in on itself.
	
	We pulled into port, which was in a dazzling multi-colored cavern. "Hey! My paint job!" Sib exclaimed as hot wax spilled onto the car. The
	Sheriff came onto the radio, "Sorry about that, hehe, just a little weather." Stalagmites hung over us, their colors bleeding into 
	eachother and out of their tips. It sounded like rain beating down on the van, though the sound softened quickly as the wax formed
	a layer on the roof. The dock itself looked like a classical sea harbor than a space port. It didn't even seem to have proper docking
	mechanisms, instead ships lazily bobbed in place, tied to the dock via ropes. 
	[later]
	"I mean, this can't be sustainable, right?" The sheriff leaned back in his goofy recliner; the chair itself didn't lean back so much as it
<<<<<<< HEAD
	just let him sink in. He popped his boots onto the what appeared to be a stone wheel, straihgt out of a caveman toon, the inprints 
	suggesting that this isn't the first time. "Guy, I'm just trying to make it to low brite[the evening]. The candle that worries 
	about tomorrow burns at both ends, savvy?" I didn't.
