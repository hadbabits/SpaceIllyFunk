Narritive:
	It's a space road trip?:
		The last road trip; one by one you see the remaining sites, and hear their songs (the radio signals)
		You strip the sounds for the galaxy one by one as it goes dark.
		
		Maybe something catyclysmic has occured, or an act of grand bueracracy (ala Hitchhiker's Guide) 
	
	THE CONFLICT:
		Some kind of massive catastrophe is looming in the galaxy. No one's really sure of the particular nature of the threat,
		but the main character is told that people in the know have declared that the end of everything is near.
		
		The PC had never left their home planet, and with the end in sight they decide to abandon their dead-end job, pile in
		their space-van, perhaps with a partner and dog?, and flies off into the big black, with nothing on their dashboard
		save for a traffic ticket that would never be payed.
		
		During this journey you discover the various peoples across the system and how they deal, or don't deal, with the 
		upcoming disaster. The player won't save the system, it will be left in about the same state as when you arrived,
		because you can't alone deal with something so large. The game will not end with you failing or succeeding in
		saving the universe, but with the player deciding if they want to try at all.
	
	The Insect Tribe (Based on Digable Planets):
		A people who believe the universe is centered around music and 'vibes'. They came from a planet of funk,
		now defunct ('defunked' ha), but as long as they can find rythym among the stars they keep in good spirits;
		a common saying being "If I can jam, then I am."
		
		In a similar vein they don't mourn they're lost home; coming from a heavily urbanized civilization. A concrete
		jungle, which can always be rebuilt. Though some may miss some of the sights from that jungle, like the towering
		trees, street lights, creating a canopy of light protecting them from the dark void above
		
		How do they sound?:
			More jazzy? Horns? More upbeat
		
		Humans or insects?:
			Insects: Literal insect creatures. I guess it'd make it more convenient to make them more alien
			
			Humans: They identify as insects due to how small they feel against the universe
		
	
	The Candle Cove Cult:
		A group of cynics who've given up on the absurdity of existence. They predict, or at least depict, the end as being the 
		heat death of the universe. For different reasons, be it a longing for a sense of meaningful agency or just petty spite,
		this group has a practice involving blowing out candles to contribute to the heat death. 
			This doesn't actually make any sense scientifically, I don't fink, but I still like it; the lack of sense only adds
			to the impotence of it all. Though alternatively they could be burning shit all the time. If I decide to take
			them in a more hedonistic direction that could work well; maybe even as a splinter group
	
	High Tech and the dummies who use it:
		a focus on how no matter how advanced the technology, us everyday shmucks will be the one using it; in an earnest way
		Mundane joys in fantastical settings (see: DIFFERENT FROM MY OTHER PROJECT)
		
		Maybe you're a space garbage man.... goddammmit (note to self, take a vacation)
	
	Clearly I've got some funk/folk/gypsy undercurrents in mind, need to look into that.
	
	Are there aliens or just robots... or just aliens?..... OR JUST ROBOS (Prolly not)
	
	Maybe take the human centric view that we are the center of the universe and rub that against a more happenstancial narrative
	
	Trash mass area:
		Maybe could explore our culture as disposable and consumable

Mechanics:
	UI:
		maybe the main interface is the dashboard?
	
	Environment:
		'Space woods': in contrast to Sunless Seas island based map, it'd give something a bit more involved in
		navigation (which is helpful if there's no combat)
		
		Could use a labyrinth with winding corridors to play with the signal 6layers in interesting ways
	
	Fuel:
		I could guide the player through this road trip with gas stations; out of neccesity they won't be able to just
		drive off in any direction.
		
		Add a fuel system like Sunless. This will be different in that your momentum could save you a lot of fuel
		when traveling in a straight line. This would give obstacles more signifigance since you'd have to
		use fuel to navigate it.
			Consider a mechanical option for obstacles; maybe you could crash through them, trading hull for fuel
		
		On your road trip you might need to hang around certain stops in order to make some cash for more fuel
			Oh god, gonna need another gas pump transition scene =w=
		
		Sunless had weather that affected how you traveled, could do something similar:
			Meteor shower where you need to manuever or take cover
	
	Alternatul Fuel (auto pilot):
		So if the fuel thing doesn't work out, or I need to restrict the player's ability to explore, I could have it
		so in between significant zones there's an autopilot mode where you could talk to your companion. while on the 'road'
	
	Radio signals:
		Radial areas with music/sounds that layer over each other and increase in clarity and volume as you 
		get closer to the source
	
	Space can't be empty, or at least shouldn't, what're we digging through?
		Sunless Skies/Sea approach where the boundaries define the playspace more signficantly
	
	Space litter: Some consumables can be thrown out your window
		Maybe there's a huge mass of litter, pulled together by gravity, you have to navigate
			An area entirely composed of space little pulled together by gravity could be out there
				AND WHEN YOU LITTER IT WILL DRIFT TOWARD IT
	
	Combat?
		Maybe you fire the garbage you collect

Aesthetic:
	Space:
		Maybe look into those wild shapes they used to throw in old cartoon with fast jazz going, if ye remember
