Narritive:
	It's a space road trip?:
		The last road trip; one by one you see the remaining sites, and hear their songs (the radio signals)
		You strip the sounds for the galaxy one by one as it goes dark.
		
		Maybe something catyclysmic has occured, or an act of grand bueracracy (ala Hitchhiker's Guide) 
	
	THE CONFLICT:
		Some kind of massive catastrophe is looming in the galaxy. No one's really sure of the particular nature of the threat,
		but the main character is told that people in the know have declared that the end of everything is near.
		
		The PC had never left their home planet, and with the end in sight they decide to abandon their dead-end job, pile in
		their space-van, perhaps with a partner and dog?, and flies off into the big black, with nothing on their dashboard
		save for a traffic ticket that would never be payed.
		
		During this journey you discover the various peoples across the system and how they deal, or don't deal, with the 
		upcoming disaster. The player won't save the system, it will be left in about the same state as when you arrived,
		because you can't alone deal with something so large. The game will not end with you failing or succeeding in
		saving the universe, but with the player deciding if they want to try at all.
	
	World state:
		Post-tech ecenomical doldroms:
			People are living day to day. Many populations rely on technologies from better times to sustain themselves, like the wax
			people relying on a Mung-Bean shake machine for their food. 
	
	Slang ideas:
		Could use 'ear' for 'hear', like 'Did you ear that?' or "You ear'd about that?"
		Cuzz: Local term of endearment, based on 'cousin'; also used to describe people being friendly, "Why you being so cuzzy?" 
		Swik: Means quick, 'Get it done, lickety-Swik like
		Liberal use of apostrophes for conciseness and flavour, "You ear'd me" 
		S'muk: 'schmuck', sometimes modified to "s'mukker" (or maybe even udder s'mukker or s'muk head, if you wanna be scandolous) 
		pRs'd (pRsd officially): The past, spelt out in AI SwikWrit(tm), refers parsed data of the old times. Pronounced like a pirate saying 'past' 
	
	The digital people:
		A group with a focus on technology and the vapidness of data. They're the lot responsible for maintaining the pRsd; even if
		many of them have a blatant disregard for it, others wishing to capatilize on 'content'. 
		
		Maybe giving up their physical existence has driven them to a hinduist state of minnd; they see the physical world as an illusion and
		aren't very concerned about the end of it: for them existence is a very passive experience, waiting for new content and changes to occur.
		Could also drive the idea that they're espeically removed because we already live in our own worlds, they just live another layer deeper.
		
		They have a strange sense of identity: They frequently play with them since they're still reduced to avatars and usernames. What's more,
		it's not uncommon for them to be living multiple lives with different social circles. 
		
		Cyber Space:
			A lone charge station sits out in the middle of no where, that's where these people live. Plug in and you enter their cyber space.
	
	The Wax Planet:
		Initially the founder of the wax planet just wanted the largest wax muesem in the world, but somehow the project spiraled in scale until
		it became a world in itself. Unfortunately the great downsizing put it close to a star, and the collosal decorative wick at the planet's
		north pole proved even more unfortunate. By the downsizing's end it was out of range of the star, but was left in a cold spot, so the 
		population found itself having to keep the flame going so they wouldn't freeze. Now the planet looked like a rotting apple, the top
		collapsing in on itself.
		
		Their lives are built on ever shifting 'sands'; they're architecture is warped improv of the 'old world' always melting and shifting,
		additions being slapped on where necassary. S'pose it could be a kind of 'physical internet' where all of pop culture, since the planet
		is a facsimile of 'earth', gets mashed up 
		
		The Candle Cult:
			A product of their environment, most of the cult members carry a stark sense that everything is finite and they're on a crash course
			with oblivion whether they like it or not. They've adopted the 'cold death' of the universe as their religious doctrine: Heat death
			was a concern during expansion, but ever since the Great Downsizing the opposite threat has been posed, that everything will be
			consumed by fire as we're compacted by the forces of the universe. 
			
			The cult has ceremonies where they light candles, despite how obviously bad it is for their planet's situation. It gives many cult
			members a small sense of agency. The world is ending, and they all wanna put a nail in the coffin, for various reasons.
	
	The Insect Tribe (Based on Digable Planets):
		A people who believe the universe is centered around music and 'vibes'. They came from a planet of funk,
		now defunct ('defunked' ha), but as long as they can find rythym among the stars they keep in good spirits;
		a common saying being "If I can jam, then I am."
		
		In a similar vein they don't mourn they're lost home; coming from a heavily urbanized civilization. A concrete
		jungle, which can always be rebuilt. Though some may miss some of the sights from that jungle, like the towering
		trees, street lights, creating a canopy of light protecting them from the dark void above
		
		How do they sound?:
			More jazzy? Horns? More upbeat
		
		Humans or insects?:
			Insects: Literal insect creatures. I guess it'd make it more convenient to make them more alien
			
			Humans: They identify as insects due to how small they feel against the universe
		
	
	High Tech and the dummies who use it:
		a focus on how no matter how advanced the technology, us everyday shmucks will be the one using it; in an earnest way
		Mundane joys in fantastical settings (see: DIFFERENT FROM MY OTHER PROJECT)
		
		Maybe you're a space garbage man.... goddammmit (note to self, take a vacation)
	
	Clearly I've got some funk/folk/gypsy undercurrents in mind, need to look into that.
	
	Are there aliens or just robots... or just aliens?..... OR JUST ROBOS (Prolly not)
	
	Maybe take the human centric view that we are the center of the universe and rub that against a more happenstancial narrative
	
	Trash mass area:
		Maybe could explore our culture as disposable and consumable

Mechanics:
	UI:
		maybe the main interface is the dashboard?
	
	Environment:
		'Space woods': in contrast to Sunless Seas island based map, it'd give something a bit more involved in
		navigation (which is helpful if there's no combat)
		
		Could use a labyrinth with winding corridors to play with the signal 6layers in interesting ways
	
	Fuel:
		I could guide the player through this road trip with gas stations; out of neccesity they won't be able to just
		drive off in any direction.
		
		Add a fuel system like Sunless. This will be different in that your momentum could save you a lot of fuel
		when traveling in a straight line. This would give obstacles more signifigance since you'd have to
		use fuel to navigate it.
			Consider a mechanical option for obstacles; maybe you could crash through them, trading hull for fuel
		
		On your road trip you might need to hang around certain stops in order to make some cash for more fuel
			Oh god, gonna need another gas pump transition scene =w=
		
		Sunless had weather that affected how you traveled, could do something similar:
			Meteor shower where you need to manuever or take cover
	
	Alternatul Fuel (auto pilot):
		So if the fuel thing doesn't work out, or I need to restrict the player's ability to explore, I could have it
		so in between significant zones there's an autopilot mode where you could talk to your companion. while on the 'road'
	
	Radio signals:
		Radial areas with music/sounds that layer over each other and increase in clarity and volume as you 
		get closer to the source
	
	Space can't be empty, or at least shouldn't, what're we digging through?
		Sunless Skies/Sea approach where the boundaries define the playspace more signficantly
	
	Space litter: Some consumables can be thrown out your window
		Maybe there's a huge mass of litter, pulled together by gravity, you have to navigate
			An area entirely composed of space little pulled together by gravity could be out there
				AND WHEN YOU LITTER IT WILL DRIFT TOWARD IT
	
	Combat?
		Maybe you fire the garbage you collect

Aesthetic:
	Space:
		Maybe look into those wild shapes they used to throw in old cartoon with fast jazz going, if ye remember
